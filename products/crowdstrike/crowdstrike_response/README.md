# CrowdStrike Response
Story to alert on, and respond to CrowdStrike alerts and events.

By default, this story will send an email containing details of each alert. The recipient can initiate response actions, such as containing the device in Crowdstrike, by clicking links in the email body.

Template formatting for Jira and The Hive incidents can be found in the 'Build Detection' agent. These can be used to quickly configure alert creation in either of those platforms.
